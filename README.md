 how to establish a cybersecurity web application using data science tools.Focusing on four important aspects: detecting phishing emails, combatting cyberbullying, combating fake news, and implementing sentiment analysis
Our web application, designed for local use, features a cyberbullying detection system that analyzes online messages and behaviors to identify cases of harassment and bullying. Thanks to machine learning and deep learning algorithms, we can detect malicious content and help prevent the harmful consequences of cyberbullying.

Furthermore, our web application is equipped with a mechanism for detecting malicious URLs. It examines links included in emails and messages to identify potentially dangerous websites. This enhances protection against phishing attacks, phishing websites, and attempts to steal sensitive information.

We have also integrated a feature for detecting fake news to combat the spread of misinformation online. Using advanced analysis techniques, we can identify deceptive content and assist users in making informed decisions based on reliable information.

Additionally, we have developed an innovative Chrome extension that utilizes advanced data science tools to predict the nature of an email directly within Gmail. This extension, still in development, will provide an additional layer of protection against online threats.

By using machine learning and deep learning models trained on extensive datasets, our extension will be capable of detecting suspicious emails, such as phishing attempts, messages containing malicious URLs, or emails associated with cyberbullying attacks.
I respectfully invite all of you to take a few moments to watch our promotional video highlighting our cybersecurity project and emphasizing the importance of our work.
